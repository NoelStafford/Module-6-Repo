# Module-6-Repo

The purpose of this module was to build a a weather tracker that could display the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast. This exercise taught us how to generate API keys and how to link them. We also got to use jquery for this assignment to help
us as well. We aslo used the moment feature to show the date and time.

I would like to thank my teachers and fellow classmates for assistance on this homework and helping me to understand it and manage to complete it on time.
